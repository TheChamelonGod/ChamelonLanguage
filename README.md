# ChamelonLanguage

Built-in a 24-hour hackathon called Scrapyard!
Made with Python, OpenCv, and Mediapipe.


# *How I Made It! (And the pain I got along the way)*

I first followed a tutorial on OpenCv and how it works, went through many iterations, and tried way too hard to find the right tutorial until I gave up. I then found a half-completed tutorial of detecting sign language sign with OpenCv and went along with it, then realized that it was outdated or just didn't work so I branched off of it and made my own sign language detector. Around this time I burned through 16 hours or so and was reaching the end soon. I thought I could get some sleep but instead pulled an all-nighter trying to finish the project. The last few hours were me getting 3rd in a Supper Smash Bros tournament and tearing my hair out trying to get the thing to work. In the end, I got it to work but couldn't export it as an .exe file so I couldn't submit it. 


## Setting this up for yourself

I honestly don't know how. So I'm making this stuff up so don't blame me if this doesn't work.

Download this, open this up in PyCharm or VsCode, and install the dependencies. Then run collect_imgs, follow the instructions on there, after that, run create_dataset. (You should probably turn down the number of images you take in the collect_imgs.py, I turned it up to 500 just to see if it makes a difference, it really doesn't but you probably shouldn't keep it at 500) Then you should be good to go!




Also, I DID SPELL THE PROJECT CORRECTLY, IT PURPOSELY ISN'T CHAMELEON
